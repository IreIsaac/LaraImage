# Laraimage

I am a fan of the php leagues Glide Image package and use it in most of my projects. This package will hopefully save someone else some time. Let me know if you handle integrating Glide into laravel differently.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require ireisaac/laraimage
```
Register service provider in config/app.php,  at the end of the long providers array I'd check around line 155-160
``` php
    'providers' => [
        ...
        IreIsaac\LaraImage\ImageServiceProvider::class,
    ]
```
If you want to have access to an ever so handy facade register it in config/app.php
``` php
    'Image' => \IreIsaac\LaraImage\ImageFacade::class,
```
If you would like to use an artisan command to clear cached images generated by the application use the included command.
in the file app/Console/Kernel.php add
``` php
    protected $commands = [
        ...
        IreIsaac\LaraImage\Commands\ClearImageCache::class,
    ];
```
To render a default image when a requested image does not exists, place an image named "ImageNotFound" in storage/app/images/default/, now you can add the following snippet to App\Exceptions\Handler@render and voila. 
``` php
    if($e instanceof \League\Glide\Filesystem\FileNotFoundException) {

        return Image::outputImage('/img/default/ImageNotFound.png', $request->toArray());
    }
```
